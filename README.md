# Introduction 

So you want to learn Java and become a coder-jedi, but don't know where to start ? 

This guide is written by a self-taugh programmer for all the other self-taught programmers out there. 
Its purpose is to get you from zero to hero with the Java technology stack with minimal amount of effort 
and also in a way, which will allow you to enjoy the journey. 

There is an ocean of information out there ... and which resources do you pick ... and which study
techniques do you use to "load them into your head" ... and how do you keep yourself motivated to not give up 
on this journey, which is not always so easy ... 

This repository serves as a study guide, which will allow you to go from having zero knowledge about programming 
to a software architect. You can think of it as a dusty "How to become a jedi master" book you stumble upon while
digging through the basement in your grandmothers house XD

The system described here is tried and tested by me and my students with phenomenal results. 
Focus, work smart, work hard, never doubt yourself, ALWAYS believe in yourself ... and you will get there. 

No doubts, no fatigue, only forward, only victory !!

# How to use this guide

OK, so in order to become a Java developer you need to learn some concepts and gain some skills. 
In order to do this you will need to read the theory from this guide and do the practical exercises.
These are grouped below into junior/mid/senior categories.

This is the answer to the question - "What do you do?", however an equally important question is 
"How do you do it?". You want to study in a way, which is both effetive and efficient and also, probably, 
you want to have some fun along the way. 

Therefore, I highly suggest, you read the "Study Techniques" section (describes how to study programming efficiently) and 
"Mind Games" section (describes how to create unbreackable motivation) before moving on to the technical stuff. 
Remember, the part of your body, which makes the code is your brain.
You want to configure it for optimal performance.

Therefore, you have a choice to read these two sections before jumping to the technical stuff and move faster and with less effort 
or ignore these two sections and move slower with more effort. The choice is up to you. 

# Study techniques
- Feynman method 
- Visual note taking
- Revision schedule 
- Studying programing is like studying sex

# Mind games 
- Affirmations
- Why do you want it 

# Junior Developer 

- Java Rush
- Spring Framework beginner to Guru 
- Maven 
- Git 
- SQL 
- Bash 
- Basic IT knowledge

# Mid-level Developer 
# Senior Developer 
# Software architect
OK, so this is where the real fun starts ... you're done being a jedi padawan at this point. And you start gunning towards being a jedi master.
Below is a list of key resources, which will help you advance towards a software architect role in broad strides.

**Theory:**
1) [AWS well-architected framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) and its 5 pillars. This is a collection of best practices for reaching non-functional attributes, which are highly desirable for any IT system: Security, Reliability, Pefrormance Efficiency, Cost Optimisation, Operational Efficiency.

2) [MIT Distributed Systems Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7WrbZTCODu1o_kfUMq88g). Every system in 2021 is beyond is a distributed system. Such is the reality of enterprise software development right now. Even for simple startups in addition to the main monolithic application there will be some other AWS lambdas or similar services that interact with it.

3) [MIT Security Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6Ht2dJt3SKN3z4S6nOvuJtesDXbly7S). Every customer wants a secure system, even though noone will explicity tells you about it. You need a robust mental framework to design your systems with security in mind from day 0. This will help avoid costly rearchitecturing if flaws are found further down the line. 

4) [Enterprise Integration Patterns Book](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) Again, every system right now is a distributed system. Therefore, you need to have the knowledge and the skills about how to make them work together in an efficient way. 

**Practice:**
OK, so you've learned some concepts from the theory section. Hey, guess what ? Theory without practice is dead !
Therefore, what you'll need to do to grow as an architect is construct the architectures you image out of AWS components
plus some custom code to "glue" everything together.

After this what you should do is apply functional tests, load tests and some security testing to see how your architecture 
is able to correctly and reliably proces the expected workload in a secure way. 

1) Prepare for and pass the **AWS Certified Developer** certification. 
This course will familiarise you with a broad range of AWS services and how to use each one in a good way.
Very solid foundation to build you AWS knowledge on.

2) Prepare for and pass the **AWS Certified DevOps** engineer. 
Teaches you all the good DevOpsy stuff like CI/CD, Infrastructure as code, etc ... as an architect its desirable that you 
understand every aspect of what makes a reliable back-end.

3) Prepare for and pass the **Kubernetes Cloud Administrator** certification.
4) You need to learn some **load testing** tools/techniques.
