# Introduction 

So you want to learn Java and become a coder-jedi, but don't know where to start ? 

This guide is written by a self-taugh programmer for all the other self-taught programmers out there. 
Its purpose is to get you from zero to hero with the Java technology stack with minimal amount of effort 
and also in a way, which will allow you to enjoy the journey. 

There is an ocean of information out there ... and which resources do you pick ... and which study
techniques do you use to "load them into your head" ... and how do you keep yourself motivated to not give up 
on this journey, which is not always so easy ... 

This repository serves as a study guide, which will allow you to go from having zero knowledge about programming 
to a software architect. You can think of it as a dusty "How to become a jedi master" book you stumble upon while
digging through the basement in your grandmothers house XD

The system described here is tried and tested by me and my students with phenomenal results. 
Focus, work smart, work hard, never doubt yourself, ALWAYS believe in yourself ... and you will get there. 

No doubts, no fatigue, only forward, only victory !!

# How to use this guide

OK, so in order to become a Java developer you need to learn some concepts and gain some skills. 
In order to do this you will need to read the theory from this guide and do the practical exercises.
These are grouped below into junior/mid/senior categories.

This is the answer to the question - "What do you do?", however an equally important question is 
"How do you do it?". You want to study in a way, which is both effetive and efficient and also, probably, 
you want to have some fun along the way. 

Therefore, I highly suggest, you read the "Study Techniques" section (describes how to study programming efficiently) and 
"Mind Games" section (describes how to create unbreackable motivation) before moving on to the technical stuff. 
Remember, the part of your body, which makes the code is your brain.
You want to configure it for optimal performance.

Therefore, you have a choice to read these two sections before jumping to the technical stuff and move faster and with less effort 
or ignore these two sections and move slower with more effort. The choice is up to you.
